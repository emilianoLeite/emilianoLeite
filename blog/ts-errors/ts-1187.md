## A parameter property may not be declared using a binding pattern.


I was writting a class with some public accessor the other day:

```ts

class Request {
  constructor(public url: string, public method: string) {}
}
```

and then I thought

> Hm, wonder if I can mix the visibility accessor shorthand with object destructuring...

and tried this:

```ts
constructor(
  public { url, method }
) {}
```

which gave me the error

```
A parameter property may not be declared using a binding pattern. ts(1187)
```

Upon googling the error, I found [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5326) and concluded this feature should be possible, but is not yet implemented in TS.
